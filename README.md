# SuperStoreDataAnalysis
SuperStore Data Analysis in Python
A comprehensive data science project that transforms raw retail data into actionable business insights through advanced analytics, statistical testing, and interactive visualizations.

üéØ Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end business intelligence analysis of a Superstore dataset, combining exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, customer segmentation, and predictive insights to drive data-driven business decisions.

üîç Key Questions Answered:
Which product categories and regions drive the highest profitability?
How do seasonal trends affect sales performance?
What customer segments offer the greatest growth potential?
Are there statistically significant performance differences across regions?
How can we optimize inventory and marketing strategies?
